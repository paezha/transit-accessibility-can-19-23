This repository is the home of the all the code and text to reproduce the report prepared for the School of Cities. The paper is written in a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) computational notebook and all the code is in the `R` statistical computing language.

Reproducibility instructions:

- Fork this repository
- Go to folder `data`
- Open file `soc_report_transit_accessibility.qmd` and render

The report uses an [Open Data Product](https://rdcu.be/dZd08), [{canaccessR}](https://paezha.github.io/canaccessR/), which contains travel time matrices by transit to employment and groceries in 2019 and 2023.

This project has a reproducible environment powered by package [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/).
